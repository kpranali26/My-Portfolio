Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pranali Kathar!

I'm a Computer Science student with a fresh mind, a curious heart, and a strong love for building things that make everyday life easier and more fun. I'm always exploring, experimenting, and learning â€” whether it's a new web framework or an AI concept that sparks my interest.

Right now, I'm enjoying working on:

ðŸŒ± Daily habit tracker apps  
ðŸ¤– AI chatbots with image understanding  
ðŸ§  Simple machine learning tools for real-world problems  

Technologies I love working with:

- React.js, Firebase, Flask  
- C++, Java, Python, JavaScript  
- SQL, Git, Gemini API  

Some of my favorite projects are already up on my GitHub â€” feel free to explore!

Outside of code, I love organizing events, being part of creative teams, and contributing to causes I believe in. Always open to collaboration, feedback, or even a quick tech chat :)

Thanks for visiting my GitHub! Let's grow and build, one step at a time âœ¨
